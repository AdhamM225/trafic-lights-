# 🚦 Arduino Traffic Light Simulation

🔧 **Overview**  
This project is written for an **Arduino Uno** and simulates a simple **traffic light system** using 3 LEDs:

- 🔴 **Red LED** on pin `13`  
- 🟡 **Yellow LED** on pin `11`  
- 🟢 **Green LED** on pin `6`

The program cycles through red, yellow, and green lights in a timed sequence to mimic a real-world traffic light.

## 📋 How It Works

1. Red LED turns ON for 3 seconds, then OFF.
2. Yellow LED blinks 3 times (each blink: 1 second ON, 1 second OFF).
3. Green LED turns ON for 3 seconds, then OFF.
4. The cycle repeats.
